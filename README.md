# RogueLogic
Mostly "RogueLogic Era" Code Currently being refactored into IlardiSystems. RogueLogic and RogueLogic.com was my main web site from 1999. I began using the IlardiSystems moniker around 2021 and have been increasingly migrating my personal sites to ilardi.com as my main domain name and presense on the internet. All "Ilardi Code" moving forward will be part of IlardiSystems or other monikers as needed. RogueLogic and RogueLogic.com will continue to exist in some form, and finally probably be retired to a redirect to ilardi.com in the future. Other domains I have used and still own follow this same pattern and forward to sub-domains on ilardi.com

Within the RogueLogic Repository you will find almost 2 decades of Java Code written in my personal time for person projects, open source projects, and even some code I wrote as attempts at start ups.

Some of the ideas and projects are over 25 years old as of December 2023. Again, RogueLogic started in 1999 and some project ideas go back even further.

Specifically my interests since college has been Socket programming and I spent many years refactoring the "RL-Talk" application level protocol in various langauges starting in 1997. You will find the latest version which has been stable since 2005.

RT-Talk and the accompaning com.roguelogic.net package might be some of the most interesting code to browse here.

It is currently being refactored from scratch using updated programming techniques and design patterns I have learned over the last 18 years as part of IlardiSystems' "net" package, which makes use of Factories, Adapters, Facades, etc to provide Socket implementations that are either NIO Non-Blocking which the current version in this RogueLogic repo uses, and older blocking I/O techniques. I have also started to abstract SSL/TLS in the new Socket wrapper utilities.

RT-Talk will either be rebranded as Ilardi-Talk or IS-Talk or something similar, or perhaps I might keep the RL-Talk branding, expansions on the Protocol are planned as well, including RL-Talk over HTTP/S and potentially a RESTful form of RL-Talk.
